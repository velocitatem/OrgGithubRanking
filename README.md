# OrgGithubRanking

OrgGithubRanking is a utility script designed to gather and compile key statistics for members of any GitHub organization. This script collects metrics like followers, following, public repositories, and public gists. Additionally, it retrieves the most recent commit activities for each user's last updated repositories. The compiled data is then prepared to be sent to a main server for further analysis or display.
